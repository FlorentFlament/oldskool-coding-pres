Demoscene
---------

* Computer art subculture

* Born in 1980s as "copyparties"

* Still dozens of demoparties every year

.. note::

   The demoscene is a form of computer art culture characterized by
   events called demoparties. These events gather tens to hundreds of
   participants (called demosceners or sceners), most of them
   participating to organized competitions (called compos). During
   these compos, groups of sceners present their so-called demos,
   consisting of animated drawings, effects, 3D models and musics put
   together programmatically and in real time. Although demoscene
   groups may have dozens of members, demos are usually made by small
   teams consisting of 2-4 people (for instance, a graphic artist, a
   musician and a coder). Most demoparties also host musics, graphics,
   and sometimes photos competitions.

   Demoparties originate from copyparties happening in the 1980s,
   where computer enthusiasts met together to copy (and crack)
   software. Cracker groups usually added a short intro (animated
   graphics with music) to the software they cracked. Later in the
   1980s, groups focusing on making demos, rather than cracking
   software appeared leading to a fork between the "crackscene" and
   the "demoscene". As of today, there are still dozens of demoparties
   happening (mostly in Europe - like the Revision, Evoke and Assembly
   parties) every year, usually gathering dozens to hundreds of
   participants (Revision 2018 hosted around 700 participants).

* Limited size demos (or intros)

* Unrestricted demos

* Shader showdown (live coding)

Oldskool demos
--------------

* Platform constraints (8bit or 16bit)

* Limited vs Unlimited size oldskool demos

* Per platform compos

Community
---------

* Almost every demos are available on Pouet and Demozoo

* Events streamed through Twitch

* Scenesat.tv
